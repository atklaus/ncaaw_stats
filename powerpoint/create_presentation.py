      * NBA combine data from NBA.com
      * College statistics from Sports-Reference.com

    NBA Success Definition: * Player Efficiency Rating (PER): A measure of per-minute production standardized such that the league average is 15.
      * Win Shares (WS): An estimate of the number of wins contributed by a player.
      * Win Shares per 48 minutes (WS/48): Win Shares per 48 minutes played.

    Key Findings: * Machine learning model effectively predicted NBA success using college stats and NBA combine data
      * Importance of athleticism and college performance

      * Value Over Replacement Player (VORP): A box score estimate of the points per 100 team possessions a player contributed above a replacement-level (-2.0) player, translated to an average team, and prorated to an 82-game season.

    Key Findings: * Text-based scouting reports contain valuable predictive information
      * Analysis of report content can help predict player performance in the NBA

    Key Findings: * Precocious athletes (young players who enter the NBA early) earn more and have longer careers
      * Age at entry positively correlated with career earnings and longevity
